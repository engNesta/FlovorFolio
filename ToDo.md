# Project Troubleshooting To-Do List

## Overview
This to-do list is designed to address issues encountered during the development of the Recipe Book application. It focuses on systematic troubleshooting and incremental improvements.

### 1. Investigate `toLowerCase` TypeError

- **Check Third-Party Scripts**: Investigate if `content.1d473d26.js` is related to a third-party library or an auto-generated file and review its integration.
- **Review Data Passed to Functions**: Ensure data passed to methods like `toLowerCase` are strings and defined.

### 2. Resolve 409 Conflict Errors

- **Understand the Conflict**: Determine what conditions are causing the 409 Conflict errors on POST requests to `/api/recipes`.
- **Modify Server Logic (If Necessary)**: Adjust server-side logic if the conflict conditions are too strict or not correctly implemented.
- **Enhance Client-Side Validation**: Implement client-side validation to prevent requests that would result in conflicts.

### 3. Client-Side Error Handling

- **Improve Error Messaging**: Enhance error handling to provide clearer, user-friendly messages.
- **Review Server Responses**: Inspect server responses for detailed error messages or codes to understand the cause of conflicts.

### 4. Testing and Validation

- **Manual Testing**: Perform manual tests for adding, editing, and deleting recipes to ensure proper functionality.
- **Use Developer Tools**: Utilize browser developer tools for debugging, inspecting network requests, and console logs.
- **Server Logs**: Check server logs for additional error messages or warnings that could provide insights.

### 5. Code Review and Cleanup

- **Review `app.js`**: Thoroughly review your `app.js` file for any potential issues, such as typos, logic errors, or unnecessary code.
- **Consistency Check**: Ensure that data structures and types are used consistently across your application.

## Additional Tips

- **Breakpoints and Debugging**: Use breakpoints in browser developer tools or `console.log()` statements to debug the application flow.
- **Documentation and Community**: Refer to official documentation for libraries or frameworks used. Consider community resources like Stack Overflow for specific issues.
